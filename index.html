            <h1>Welcome to my landing page <br /> Created for The Odin Project</h1>
    <p>This page is designed to be a scratch pad / test bed for various Odin-related projects and will include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and other related libraries and frameworks.</p>

                    Sparky worked for weeks on his rocket ship. He was determined to get home, and he knew that this was his only chance. Finally, his rocket ship was finished. He climbed inside and blasted off into space.
                    
                    Sparky's rocket ship took him on a wild ride. He flew through asteroid fields and past comets. He even saw a few planets. But Sparky never gave up. He kept flying until he finally reached his home planet.
                    
                    Sparky landed safely in his backyard. He was so happy to be home. He ran to his house and wagged his tail so hard that his whole body wiggled. Sparky's owner was so happy to see him again. He gave Sparky a big hug and told him that he loved him.
                    
                    Sparky was so glad to be home. He had learned a valuable lesson: never give up on your dreams, even if they seem impossible.
